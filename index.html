        The Roblox Curated Discover Page (RCDP) is an unofficial, proof of concept website which showcases small (less than 1k concurrent players), hand-picked games from Roblox and features a tag system as seen on Steam and other game distribution platforms. This site allows you to easily discover games from smaller developers! (which is <a href="about.html">difficult</a> to do on the platform right now)
      </h3>
      <h3 class="desc">
        Disclaimer: The RCDP does not, and will not include every game on Roblox and it also does not display games in a comprehensive way. This site will only be used to discover smaller developers. My main goal is to maintain this website until Roblox announces plans to improve game discovery. Finally, if you are a developer or a developer team and want your game to be added to the RCDP, you can make a request <a href="https://forms.gle/DfRypxqGuD5FFGMy7" target="_blank">here</a>. (Games will be added on a monthly basis)
